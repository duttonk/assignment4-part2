Tasks: Watch Thursday night tutoring session video, continue working locally. I tested code on the OSU server briefly, but the lag time was just so huge that I got frustrated immediately. I pulled everything and worked locally all day until very late, at which point I uploaded the files to the server, changed the database inputs, and tested it on the server. Even this took over an hour due to the sluggish responsiveness of the server. Throughout the day I would simultaneously work and google, constantly looking for guidance and solutions to my problems with the code I was writing. I relied heavily on stackoverflow, php.net, W3Schools, the Thursday night tutorial, source videos, and other "google-able" resources. Finally at the end of the night I realized I had never actually made my initial commit into git, so I committed and uploaded all my files there as well.
